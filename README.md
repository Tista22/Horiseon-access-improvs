# Horiseon-accessibility-improvs


## Description 

This is a refractor code project assigned from Horiseon (Digital Marketing Agency), in order to improve the accessibility of their website for their clients. 
In order to ensure that Horiseon's requests was met, the 'acceptance criteria' was vital as a guide to ensure, I was on the right track for the improvements. 

The 'acceptance criteria' is as follows: 
Your website must meet accessibility standards. You can achieve this completing the following:
- Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code.
- HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- Image and icon elements contain accessible alt attributes
- Heading attributes fall in sequential order
- Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title

Improvements were as follows: 
- Comments were made to HTML and CSS files, regarding semantic html tags in order to provide initial structure to code. This is due to div tags being predominantly used in the code. 
- A new title was given (Horiseon 'Digital Marketing Agency'). 
- 'alt' attributes were given to each image tag.
- A re-organisation of CSS in order to match HTML
- Additional comments were made for clarity. 



## Installation 
(videos inserted here)

The website is now deployed and live and can be accessed via any browser (Google Chrome, Safari, Mozilla Firefox).

In order to see some of the Accessibility features, with the use of the developer tools feature or right clicking 'inspect' on Horiseon's webpage can give you access to see alt attributes and in order to help further view accessibility features in case further improvements are needed.
